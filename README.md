# The Nightmare Before UXmas
A collection of spooky, christmas themed UX examples that will make you appreciate your designer friends.

## Reason for this Project

> “Ease of use may be invisible, but its absence sure isn’t.”

The main goal of this project is to learn about great design, by examining the exact opposite. We aim to build a site that has examples of the most god awful, infuriating UX possible, in order to highlight the tennants of great design by contrast.

## Theme

Keeping in-line with the project name, all examples should be spooky christmas themed.

## Structure

The structure of the site will consiste of a landing page with a brief overview of the project. Then there will be a collection of searchable links that each direct the user to an example.

## Examples

Each example should present a small challenge/puzzle to the user, by virtue of how difficult the UX is. In this way the site will somewhat gamified and remain enaging.
